These are the projects that I have been doing for the past few years ever since I started out as a software engineering student and continued on with personal projects after graduation.

Feel free to give me feedback  via github issues or just messaging me on LinkedIn or anything. At this point, with me figuring out AI and my own skillset, I want to at least know whether my learning experience is not a waste or what I could do better with using AI integration, researching stuff for my problems or anything else in between.
