## Portfolio
A site for my projects, resume and volunteering networking gigs that showcase my technical and soft skills.

## GitHub Pages Path
Configured for GitHub Pages project hosting at `https://d3lk1ch1.github.io/portfolio/` using:
* `url: https://d3lk1ch1.github.io`
* `baseurl: /portfolio`

## Features
* Pages for my resume, GitHub projects and volunteering networking gigs
* Embedded PDF export for my resume and GitHub projects (because embedded link for GitHub repo does not exist)
* Embedded LinkedIn posts for my volunteering networking gigs (to show photos and what I have done)

----------------------------------
* Possible header and footer added later on
* Tentative features for site (chatbot? contact form? etc)
* Potentially exploring more layout themes later
