## Volunteering Networking Gigs
While trying to find a job and figure out my career path from a broad degree like software engineering, I take pleasure in attending many networking meetups approaching the tech trends such as AI integration, finding the sweet spot to effectively use AI and not slop, testing the waters with the job market and talking to so many people that have been nothing but encouraging, kind and helpful.

While networking, I have been lucky to get opportunities where I volunteer in many events, whether related to technical or not that helps build up my soft skills, give back to the community and learn new things as seen bellow:
